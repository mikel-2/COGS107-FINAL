# COGS107-FINAL

SDT & Diffusion Modeling Analysis

This final project will analyze certain simulated response times and accuracy data from a 2×2×2 experimental design using 2 common modeling approaches Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and the Diffusion Decision Model (DDM)

# The goals
1. To quantify the effects of 'stimulus complexity' and the trial difficulty on a subjects performance
2. Fit a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate d_prime sensitivity and bias (in c)
3. Generate delta plots to show response time distrubution 

# AI Usage
I used ChatGPT for code writing suggestions as well as to help me understand concepts of these models and analyses.
